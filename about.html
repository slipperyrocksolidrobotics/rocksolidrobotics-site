      <h1>About Rock Solid Robotics</h1>
      <p>Rock Solid Robotics is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit serving the Slippery Rock Area School District. Our mission is to provide high-quality STEM education through robotics, starting with a FIRST LEGO League (FLL) program for elementary and middle school students.</p>
      <p>We aim to build a full-spectrum robotics pipeline from elementary through high school, empowering students with engineering, coding, and teamwork skills that prepare them for the future.</p>
      <p>Located in the Pittsburgh region — a national capital of robotics — we’re inspired by institutions like Carnegie Mellon University and companies such as Carnegie Robotics, Seegrid, and Astrobotic Technology.</p>
