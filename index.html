    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Rock Solid Robotics is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to bringing world-class STEM education to students in the Slippery Rock Area School District. Through hands-on robotics instruction, we equip young minds with the skills, confidence, and curiosity to thrive in tomorrow’s technology-driven world.</p>
    <p>We’re launching with a focused FIRST LEGO League (FLL) program for elementary and middle school students — laying the foundation for a full-spectrum robotics pipeline that will eventually serve students from elementary through high school.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Engineering and coding fundamentals</li>
      <li>Teamwork and problem-solving</li>
      <li>Real-world applications of science and technology</li>
      <li>Character development through competition and collaboration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Pittsburgh?</h2>
    <p>Rock Solid Robotics is proud to call the Pittsburgh region home — a nationally recognized hub for robotics innovation. Anchored by Carnegie Mellon University’s world-renowned Robotics Institute, our area also hosts leading companies like Carnegie Robotics, Seegrid, Gecko Robotics, and Astrobotic Technology. This thriving ecosystem offers inspiration, expertise, and potential partnerships that few communities can match — and it’s right in our backyard.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>We’re not just launching a robotics team — we’re building a movement. Our long-term goal is to create a vertically integrated robotics program that supports students from their first LEGO build to advanced high school competitions. With your support, we can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expand our offerings to include FTC and FRC programs</li>
      <li>Provide scholarships and equipment for underserved students</li>
      <li>Host community STEM events and workshops</li>
      <li>Partner with local educators and industry leaders</li>
    </ul>
