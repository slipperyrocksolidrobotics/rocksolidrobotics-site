      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Rock Solid Robotics is an all-volunteer 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to advancing education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) for students in the Slippery Rock Area School District and beyond. We provide hands-on robotics-focused instruction that differs from traditional classroom STEM, emphasizing real-world problem-solving, teamwork, and competition.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Participation in FIRST LEGO League Challenge Division</li>
        <li>STEM-based events and workshops</li>
        <li>Summer robotics camps with expert instructors</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>We’re not just launching a robotics team — we’re building a movement. Our long term goal is to expand our offerings. Namely, we are looking to create:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A FIRST Technology Challenge (FTC) Division Team:</strong> FTC students work together with their mentors to design and build dynamic robots to compete in an exciting game released every September. These robots are not LEGO based like the Challenge division and require more advanced manufacturing know-how. On and off the field, students develop STEM skills, engage in community outreach, practice engineering innovation, and build confidence to help them succeed.</li>
        <li><strong>A FIRST LEGO League Explore Division Team:</strong> In Explore, teams of students ages 6–10 focus on the fundamentals of engineering as they explore real-world problems, learn to design and code, and create unique solutions made with LEGO bricks and powered by LEGO® Education SPIKE Essential.</li>
        <li><strong>Supplement the SRASD:</strong> We would like to be able to offer STEM-based kits for use by SRASD faculty to supplement their current curriculum.</li>
        <li><strong>Increase our Footprint:</strong> Currently, our teams operate out of a room at the Moraine Elementary School free-of-charge from the SRASD. We welcome students from the Slippery Rock Area Elementary and Slippery Rock Middle School in addition to students from Moraine Elementary School. As our offerings expand, we would like to expand our classroom footprint to the Slippery Rock Area Elementary and the Slippery Rock Middle School.</li>
      </ul>
